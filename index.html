	<h2><cite>History of New York Cheesecake</cite></h2>
	<article>
		<p>1929 – Arnold Reuben, owner of the legendary Turf Restaurant at 49th and Broadway in New York City, claimed that his family developed the first cream-cheese cake recipe.
		Other bakeries relied on cottage cheese.  According to legend, he was served a cheese pie in a private home, and he fell in love with the dessert.
		Using his hostess recipe and a pie she made with ingredients he provided, he then began to develop his own recipe for the perfect cheesecake.
		Reuben soon began to serve his new recipe in his Turf Restaurant, and the cheesecake quickly became very popular with the people who frequented Reubens Broadway restaurant.</p>
